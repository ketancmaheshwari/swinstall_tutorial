\title{Scientific Software Installation in the User Space\\
       \large A tutorial proposal for PEARC'21
			 }

\section*{Abstract}
In this tutorial, we propose to offer a comprehensive, definitive, clarifying
tutorial on the practice and process of scientific software installation in the
user-space on large-scale computational infrastructures.

\section*{Detailed description}
Scientific software installation process is often taken for granted. Due to
this, many installations end up being suboptimal and results in an
underperforming software and often vulnerable to complex configurations, patchy
or outright erroneous behavior. Furthermore, as the installation process varies
from software to software, it gets difficult and tedious discouraging end-users
from installing it. This results in users stuck with an older version of
software preventing them from using the latest features.  In particular with
the advent of python ecosystem, and a number of supported install methods the
waters have muddied quite a bit that often makes users resisting installing
software or face difficulties after a faulty installation.

\subsection*{Tutorial goals}
\begin{enumerate}
\item To comprehensively cover, document and present all the facets of the process and practice of scientific software installation.
\item Share knowledge of scientific software installation in user space over compute clusters and supercomputers.
\item Demonstrate best practices for software installation.
\item Clarify the concepts, principles and patterns found in the software installation process.
\item Present plenty of practical and hands-on examples of contemporary scientific software installation process.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Relevance of topic to conference attendees}
We believe the topic is relevant and useful to conference attendees. The following scenarios support our belief:
\begin{itemize}
\item A researcher experimenting with several versions of a software library would like to efficiently install them in their home area.
\item A scientist who extends a popular scientific software and would like to link it to a cluster installed library.
\item Users who would like to use specialized compilers such as NAG or PGI that are not always available systemwide.
\item Users who would like to supplement the system installed libraries for GPUs with their own Kokkos driven codes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Targeted audience}
\begin{itemize}
\item System administrators and managers who might want to re-use the tutorial for the users of their home cluster environment.
\item Science users will benefit with the clear understanding of the process of software installation crystalized and clarified.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Content level (\% beginner, \% intermediate, \% advanced)}
80 \% Beginner, 10 \% intermediate, 10 \% advanced
\subsection*{Audience prerequisites}
Basic knowledge and hands-on experience on Linux command-line. Understanding of
basic Linux concepts such as paths, files and directories, permissions etc.
